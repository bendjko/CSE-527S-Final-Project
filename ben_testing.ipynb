I was reading an article about an ai system (maybe a custom gpt) that was being trained to identify candidates for a material to be used in a new type of battery.  the material had to have certain properties and the ai was able to limit thousands of initial candidates down to a much more manageable number of candidates. I have seen a lot of creative uses for llms in chemistry and medicine like this where researchers start with a large initial data set and ask a gpt based system to filter out elements that aren’t relevant to obtain a more manageable one.</td>\n",
       "      <td>I think generally LLMs will be good at taking a large number of objects with known properties, understanding why they have the properties they do, and generalizing to similar objects with unknown properties.  This is very useful in medicine, biology, chemistry, etc as I mentioned above, but this is also the principle behind text prediction and other llm uses.  Right now, though, I think llms are very bad at performing specific or precise tasks.  They have no reliable way to self-verify their information or to generate new ideas.  So very fine tasks related to advanced/research level problems are out of the question (my math homework, for example, is already too advanced for gpt).</td>\n",

Especially because gpt 3 was training based on user input, it could spit that private data back out in a response to someone else.  The same concerns arise for academics who want to use gpt in their research.  I think intellectual property violations are also a concern.  AI art generators are being trained without credit or compensation on artist work that is protected by intellectual property laws.  It could also happen that I ask chat gpt a question and it provides an answer that relies on a recent research paper in the field.  I might publish this based on what gpt told me not realizing I needed to cite the original paper.\\n\\nIt could also be possible that llms analyze and store information about the writing styles of users.  Similarly to how we can distinguish AI-generated from human text, AI might be able to distinguish different human text samples based on the unique style of the author.  This could compromise privacy in huge ways.  Maybe a referee for a journal who blind reviews papers might try to use gpt to determine the author of the manuscript they received for review based on previous papers in the field, and that could introduce bias into the review process.</td>\n",

AI models just aren’t able to describe why they think a problem is interesting or approachable, or how they came up with the approach for the solution.  If people over rely on llm in math, the results could become highly unmotivated and decontextualized.  \\n\\nAlso, the way that mathematicians cite results poses problems: often, one paper contains many many results, which can be stated in many different but equivalent ways.  Often these results are substantially reformulated when they become standard enough to be in textbooks or monographs. It may be hard for an llm to understand different equivalent formulations of the same ideas, or scan a paper and understand the many results inside and the key types of arguments used.</td>\n",

       "2  I think generally LLMs will be good at taking a large number of objects with known properties, understanding why they have the properties they do, and generalizing to similar objects with unknown properties.  This is very useful in medicine, biology, chemistry, etc as I mentioned above, but this is also the principle behind text prediction and other llm uses.  Right now, though, I think llms are very bad at performing specific or precise tasks.  They have no reliable way to self-verify their information or to generate new ideas.  So very fine tasks related to advanced/research level problems are out of the question (my math homework, for example, is already too advanced for gpt).   \n",

       "2  If a company wants to do some data analysis but the data is private there will be concerns about doing this on a public gpt server, where the security could be compromised.  Especially because gpt 3 was training based on user input, it could spit that private data back out in a response to someone else.  The same concerns arise for academics who want to use gpt in their research.  I think intellectual property violations are also a concern.  AI art generators are being trained without credit or compensation on artist work that is protected by intellectual property laws.  It could also happen that I ask chat gpt a question and it provides an answer that relies on a recent research paper in the field.  I might publish this based on what gpt told me not realizing I needed to cite the original paper.\\n\\nIt could also be possible that llms analyze and store information about the writing styles of users.  Similarly to how we can distinguish AI-generated from human text, AI might be able to distinguish different human text samples based on the unique style of the author.  This could compromise privacy in huge ways.  Maybe a referee for a journal who blind reviews papers might try to use gpt to determine the author of the manuscript they received for review based on previous papers in the field, and that could introduce bias into the review process.   \n",

       "2  My field is mathematics.  ChatGPT can almost never help me on my problems.  I think it could be problematic to rely heavily on llm in math though, if it ever gets good enough.  The reason being that most insight about mathematical frameworks comes from the motivation.  AI models just aren’t able to describe why they think a problem is interesting or approachable, or how they came up with the approach for the solution.  If people over rely on llm in math, the results could become highly unmotivated and decontextualized.  \\n\\nAlso, the way that mathematicians cite results poses problems: often, one paper contains many many results, which can be stated in many different but equivalent ways.  Often these results are substantially reformulated when they become standard enough to be in textbooks or monographs. It may be hard for an llm to understand different equivalent formulations of the same ideas, or scan a paper and understand the many results inside and the key types of arguments used.     \n",

I was reading an article about an ai system (maybe a custom gpt) that was being trained to identify candidates for a material to be used in a new type of battery.  the material had to have certain properties and the ai was able to limit thousands of initial candidates down to a much more manageable number of candidates. I have seen a lot of creative uses for llms in chemistry and medicine like this where researchers start with a large initial data set and ask a gpt based system to filter out elements that aren’t relevant to obtain a more manageable one.</td>\n",

This is very useful in medicine, biology, chemistry, etc as I mentioned above, but this is also the principle behind text prediction and other llm uses.  Right now, though, I think llms are very bad at performing specific or precise tasks.  They have no reliable way to self-verify their information or to generate new ideas.  So very fine tasks related to advanced/research level problems are out of the question (my math homework, for example, is already too advanced for gpt).</td>\n",

Especially because gpt 3 was training based on user input, it could spit that private data back out in a response to someone else.  The same concerns arise for academics who want to use gpt in their research.  I think intellectual property violations are also a concern.  AI art generators are being trained without credit or compensation on artist work that is protected by intellectual property laws.  It could also happen that I ask chat gpt a question and it provides an answer that relies on a recent research paper in the field.  I might publish this based on what gpt told me not realizing I needed to cite the original paper.\\n\\nIt could also be possible that llms analyze and store information about the writing styles of users.  Similarly to how we can distinguish AI-generated from human text, AI might be able to distinguish different human text samples based on the unique style of the author.  This could compromise privacy in huge ways.  Maybe a referee for a journal who blind reviews papers might try to use gpt to determine the author of the manuscript they received for review based on previous papers in the field, and that could introduce bias into the review process.</td>\n",

AI models just aren’t able to describe why they think a problem is interesting or approachable, or how they came up with the approach for the solution.  If people over rely on llm in math, the results could become highly unmotivated and decontextualized.  \\n\\nAlso, the way that mathematicians cite results poses problems: often, one paper contains many many results, which can be stated in many different but equivalent ways.  Often these results are substantially reformulated when they become standard enough to be in textbooks or monographs. It may be hard for an llm to understand different equivalent formulations of the same ideas, or scan a paper and understand the many results inside and the key types of arguments used.</td>\n",

       "30  I will use ChatGPT as a resource to learn about new topics quickly. For example if there is a new idea I need to learn about for work or school, I will ask ChatGPT to give me an explanation of it. It is usually able to give me information concisely enough to save time over looking for multiple sources online to get the same information. If there is a part of the explanation I am unfamiliar with, I can simply ask to expand on a certain section of the response. Being able to get a medium level understand of any topic from one source has been extremely useful. I still do not use ChatGPT for deep dive explanations or work/content generation, but not because it is unable to provide those results.    \n",

       "2   classification and analysis technologies. I was reading an article about an ai system (maybe a custom gpt) that was being trained to identify candidates for a material to be used in a new type of battery.  the material had to have certain properties and the ai was able to limit thousands of initial candidates down to a much more manageable number of candidates. I have seen a lot of creative uses for llms in chemistry and medicine like this where researchers start with a large initial data set and ask a gpt based system to filter out elements that aren’t relevant to obtain a more manageable one.   \n",

This is very useful in medicine, biology, chemistry, etc as I mentioned above, but this is also the principle behind text prediction and other llm uses.  Right now, though, I think llms are very bad at performing specific or precise tasks.  They have no reliable way to self-verify their information or to generate new ideas.  So very fine tasks related to advanced/research level problems are out of the question (my math homework, for example, is already too advanced for gpt).   \n",

       "30  Scheduling - LLMs/ChatGPT could be used to create schedules that break up large goals into smaller tasks. For example trying to study for a large exam such as the MCAT/LSAT that involves a large amount of information. ChatGPT could be used to asses your strengths and weaknesses and create plans of what information you need to study given a timeline.\\n\\nMarketing - ChatGPT could be used to asses a target audience for a given product. Imagine providing information about a service or product one is trying to sell, while then using ChatGPT to find the ideal consumer or use case for it. That could then be used create ads/marketing for your product with the ideal customer in mind. \\n\\nLegal Advice - Legal information is normally drawn out and difficult to comprehend as it is usually not written in plain and simple language.

       "2   If a company wants to do some data analysis but the data is private there will be concerns about doing this on a public gpt server, where the security could be compromised.  Especially because gpt 3 was training based on user input, it could spit that private data back out in a response to someone else.  The same concerns arise for academics who want to use gpt in their research.  I think intellectual property violations are also a concern.  AI art generators are being trained without credit or compensation on artist work that is protected by intellectual property laws.  It could also happen that I ask chat gpt a question and it provides an answer that relies on a recent research paper in the field.  I might publish this based on what gpt told me not realizing I needed to cite the original paper.\\n\\nIt could also be possible that llms analyze and store information about the writing styles of users.  Similarly to how we can distinguish AI-generated from human text, AI might be able to distinguish different human text samples based on the unique style of the author.  This could compromise privacy in huge ways.  Maybe a referee for a journal who blind reviews papers might try to use gpt to determine the author of the manuscript they received for review based on previous papers in the field, and that could introduce bias into the review process.   \n",

For example, when we use Google Gemini, we review the memo (or whatever) before putting it in the file.  We have had issues with the LLM sort of making things up.  These are relatively small details, but it highlights the point.     \n",

Private companies who own and operate LLMs have a monetary incentive to sell user data and personal information people input. Also, hackers who gain information on LLM conversations could exploit personal information. Educational institutions who want to catch cheating student also have an interest in knowing who is using LLMs.   \n",

In poli sci and in the legal field, we talk about the right to privacy a lot. Part of that is the right to be forgotten. If you can types someone’s name into an LLM and receive tons of info about them, you could easily scam or impersonate them, and you could also dig up old things that hurt someone’s right to be forgotten.    \n",

I would imagine a lot of the answers that are generated would come from online forums and open source projects that any one can contribute to. This leaves security risks open and propagated through the LLM answers.   \n",

It is likely the case that there will be a bias in which individuals will trust the output from LLMs into which they are inputting, rather than the output of other LLMs which they view online. This means that individuals will become more vulnerable to security issues arising form LLMs which they personally use.    \n",

They could create phishing emails, impersonate loved ones, or be used to trick people into thinking they  are receiving a letter of some kind that they actually aren’t. I’m thinking specifically about someone receiving a cease and desist letter or a fake warrant.   \n",

       "74  LLMs will likely be able to exploit emotional vulnerabilities and feelings of loneliness in individuals in order to manipulate them. One day very soon, it will likely be impossible to accurately identify whether we are speaking to an LLM or a real person during interactions over the internet. This means that LLMs are rife for misinformation, propaganda, and polarization in order to fulfill the goals of foreign nations. Large corporations could also use LLMS to massively disseminate convincing falsehoods endorsing their products with minimal culpability.

       "2   My field is mathematics.  ChatGPT can almost never help me on my problems.  I think it could be problematic to rely heavily on llm in math though, if it ever gets good enough.  The reason being that most insight about mathematical frameworks comes from the motivation.  AI models just aren’t able to describe why they think a problem is interesting or approachable, or how they came up with the approach for the solution.  If people over rely on llm in math, the results could become highly unmotivated and decontextualized.  \\n\\nAlso, the way that mathematicians cite results poses problems: often, one paper contains many many results, which can be stated in many different but equivalent ways.  Often these results are substantially reformulated when they become standard enough to be in textbooks or monographs. It may be hard for an llm to understand different equivalent formulations of the same ideas, or scan a paper and understand the many results inside and the key types of arguments used.     \n",

       "45  This question depends on the purpose of the LLM.\\nShould an LLM be trained on sensitive, private, confidential, or otherwise non-civilian information (ex. for government or internal corporate use), fingerprinting would be an effective security deterrent against misuse, and would provide accountability. \\nHowever, for public LLMs, fingerprinting seems excessive. \\nIn both cases, I believe any training of LLMs on fingerprint data is a terrible idea.    \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **R-squared**: The R-squared value is 0.013, which indicates that only about 1.3% of the variation in initial trust levels is explained by the variation in familiarity with LLMs. This suggests that familiarity with LLMs alone does not strongly predict initial trust levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coefficient Estimates**: The coefficient for the variable \"familiarity\" is 0.0989. This suggests that for every one-unit increase in familiarity with LLMs, initial trust levels increase by approximately 0.0989 units. However, since the coefficient is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.324), we cannot conclude that this relationship is not likely due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Intercept**: The intercept (const) is 4.4704. This represents the estimated initial trust level when familiarity with LLMs is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Statistical Significance**: The p-values associated with the coefficient estimates provide information about their statistical significance. In this case, the p-value for the coefficient of \"familiarity\" is 0.324, which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05. This suggests that familiarity with LLMs is not a statistically significant predictor of initial trust levels in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Fit**: The F-statistic is 0.9850 with a associated probability of 0.324. This suggests that the overall fit of the model is not statistically significant, further indicating that familiarity with LLMs alone may not be a strong predictor of initial trust levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Assumptions**: The assumptions of linear regression (e.g., normality of residuals, homoscedasticity) should be assessed to ensure the validity of the model results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, based on these results, familiarity with LLMs does not appear to be a significant predictor of initial trust levels. Additional factors or a more complex model may be needed to better understand the determinants of initial trust in LLMs."
