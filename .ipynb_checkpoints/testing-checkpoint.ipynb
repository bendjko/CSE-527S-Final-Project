    "From the OLS regression results, we can gather several insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **R-squared**: The R-squared value is 0.013, which indicates that only about 1.3% of the variation in initial trust levels is explained by the variation in familiarity with LLMs. This suggests that familiarity with LLMs alone does not strongly predict initial trust levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coefficient Estimates**: The coefficient for the variable \"familiarity\" is 0.0989. This suggests that for every one-unit increase in familiarity with LLMs, initial trust levels increase by approximately 0.0989 units. However, since the coefficient is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.324), we cannot conclude that this relationship is not likely due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Intercept**: The intercept (const) is 4.4704. This represents the estimated initial trust level when familiarity with LLMs is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Statistical Significance**: The p-values associated with the coefficient estimates provide information about their statistical significance. In this case, the p-value for the coefficient of \"familiarity\" is 0.324, which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05. This suggests that familiarity with LLMs is not a statistically significant predictor of initial trust levels in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Fit**: The F-statistic is 0.9850 with a associated probability of 0.324. This suggests that the overall fit of the model is not statistically significant, further indicating that familiarity with LLMs alone may not be a strong predictor of initial trust levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Assumptions**: The assumptions of linear regression (e.g., normality of residuals, homoscedasticity) should be assessed to ensure the validity of the model results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, based on these results, familiarity with LLMs does not appear to be a significant predictor of initial trust levels. Additional factors or a more complex model may be needed to better understand the determinants of initial trust in LLMs."
